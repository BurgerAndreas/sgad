- use the hip energy as in @examples/example_hip.py
- use T1x dataset as in @examples/example_t1x.py
- initialize buffer with transition states or reactant+product (equilibrium) geometries

- remove torsion from the code
- remove rdkit from the code


Where do we need the graph?
use the graph creation function from the potential


- looking at Memo's examples, do we need to Eckart-project the Hessian before computing the eigenvector for GAD?
